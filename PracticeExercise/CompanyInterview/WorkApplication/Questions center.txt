Some note:
- Write a clean and readable code as quick as possible.

Here is agglomeration of Works Apps interview question:

/****************************/
Face to face interview:
/****************************/
1. Find the longest substring between 2 str

2. convert a string aaaabbbcc to a4b3c2

3. validating the sequence of parantheses. For ex :- {{{}{}}} => check whether this is a correct sequence or not.

4. whether a given string is a sub-string of another given string.

5. Given an array of random numbers. Find longest monotonically increasing subsequence. Print all subsequence (LIS) in the array (http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/longest-monotonically-increasing-subsequence-size-n-log-n/)

6. Print all the permutations of a string in sorted order

1. An orienteering map is to be given in the following format.
   ########
   #@....G#
   ##.##@##
   #..@..S#
   #@.....#
   ########
Calculate the minimum distance from the start(S) to the goal(G) with passing all the checkpoints(@).
Specification
‘.’ means an opened-block that players can pass.
‘#’ means a closed-block that players cannot pass.
It is allowed to move only by one step vertically or horizontally.
1 <= width <= 100, 1 <= height <= 100
The maximum number of checkpoints is 18.
Return -1 if given arguments do not satisfy specifications, or players cannot arrive at the goal from the start by passing all the checkpoints.
Input
The input is to be given in the following format, from the standard input.
      W H
      Row1
      Row2   
       ...
      RowH
The first row is to describe the width and the height of the orienteering map, sectioned by a space.
Output
Output into the standard output, and put a return.

2. Implement a Immutable Queue in Java.
